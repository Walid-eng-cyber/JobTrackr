/**
 * Context is a way to share data between components without having to pass props manually at every level.
 * It's a way to share state and functions between components without having to pass them down manually at every level.
 *
 * Context is implemented using the React.createContext() function.
 * This function creates a Context object that can be used to provide and consume some data.
 *
 * The value passed to the Provider component will be available to all components that are descendants of the Provider.
 *
 * The useContext() hook is used to consume the value from the context.
 *
 * Note: The useContext() hook only lets you read the context value.
 * You canâ€™t use it to update the context value.
 *
 * Note: If you want to update the context value, you need to use a different approach like state management libraries like Redux or MobX.
